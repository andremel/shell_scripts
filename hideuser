#   - save this with a .sh extension (e.g hideuser.sh) in an editor 
#   - make sure to convert to plain text and save as a .sh 
# To compile:
#   - in terminal navigate to where you saved it (i.e cd Desktop)
#   - type sudo chmod += hideuser.sh (or whatever you saved it as)
# To execute:
#   - now you can upload it to your JSS/Deploy/Munki or just execute it locally with:
#   - sudo sh hideuser.sh (or whatever you named it)
#   
# To show your hidden user folder after you run this - run these two commands in terminal:
#   sudo chflags nohidden /private/var/name_of_the_user_folder_you_hid
#   sudo chflags nohidden /Users/name_of_the_user_folder_you_hid
